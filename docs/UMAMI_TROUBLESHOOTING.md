# Umami Analytics Troubleshooting Guide

## Self-Hosted Setup Configuration

### Current Configuration
- **Umami Host**: `https://analytics.readysetllc.com`
- **Website ID**: `41e73d42-53bf-4b9a-ae31-2e2d22a02a32`
- **Script URL**: `https://analytics.readysetllc.com/script.js`

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. No Data Appearing in Dashboard

**Symptoms:**
- Test dashboard shows Umami is loaded and working
- All metrics in Umami dashboard show 0

**Possible Causes & Solutions:**

#### A. Domain Configuration
- **Issue**: Website domain not configured in Umami settings
- **Solution**: 
  1. Log into your Umami dashboard at `https://analytics.readysetllc.com`
  2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Websites
  3. Edit your website configuration
  4. Ensure the domain matches exactly (e.g., `readysetllc.com` or `www.readysetllc.com`)
  5. Make sure there are no trailing slashes or protocol prefixes

#### B. Website ID Mismatch
- **Issue**: The Website ID in your code doesn't match the one in Umami
- **Solution**:
  1. In Umami dashboard, go to Settings ‚Üí Websites
  2. Copy the exact Website ID
  3. Update `src/constants.ts` with the correct ID

#### C. CORS Configuration
- **Issue**: Browser blocks requests due to CORS policy
- **Solution**: Ensure your Umami server allows requests from your domain
  
#### D. SSL/Certificate Issues
- **Issue**: HTTPS certificate problems with analytics.readysetllc.com
- **Solution**: Verify SSL certificate is valid and properly configured

### 2. Script Loading Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Script status shows as not loaded
- Console errors related to script loading

**Debugging Steps:**
1. Check browser Network tab for failed requests to `analytics.readysetllc.com/script.js`
2. Verify the script URL is accessible directly in browser
3. Check for CORS errors in console
4. Ensure proper SSL certificate

### 3. Cookie Consent Interference

**Current Behavior:**
- Umami loads by default (privacy-focused, no cookies)
- Only blocks if user explicitly rejects analytics
- User can opt-out through cookie preferences

**If Still Having Issues:**
- Clear browser localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
- Check cookie preferences in test dashboard
- Verify consent status is not blocking Umami

## Testing and Debugging

### Use the Test Dashboard
1. Navigate to `/highlight-test`
2. Use the Umami Test Component to:
   - Verify configuration
   - Test connectivity to self-hosted instance
   - Send test events
   - Monitor logs

### Browser Console Debugging
Look for these console messages:
- `‚úÖ Umami analytics script loaded successfully from self-hosted instance`
- `üéØ Umami is ready for tracking`
- Any error messages starting with `‚ùå`

### Network Tab Verification
1. Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
2. Filter by "analytics.readysetllc.com"
3. Look for:
   - Successful loading of `script.js`
   - POST requests to `/api/send` when events are tracked

## Manual Verification Steps

### 1. Direct Script Access
Visit `https://analytics.readysetllc.com/script.js` directly in browser:
- Should load without errors
- Should show JavaScript code (not 404 or error page)

### 2. Dashboard Access
Visit `https://analytics.readysetllc.com`:
- Should load Umami login/dashboard
- Verify SSL certificate is valid

### 3. Website Configuration in Umami
In your Umami dashboard:
1. Check Settings ‚Üí Websites
2. Verify domain configuration
3. Copy Website ID and compare with code
4. Check that tracking is enabled

## Advanced Debugging

### Server-Side Logs
If you have access to your Umami server logs:
1. Check for incoming tracking requests
2. Look for errors in processing events
3. Verify database connectivity

### Database Verification
If using direct database access:
```sql
-- Check if events are being recorded
SELECT * FROM event WHERE website_id = '41e73d42-53bf-4b9a-ae31-2e2d22a02a32' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check website configuration
SELECT * FROM website WHERE website_id = '41e73d42-53bf-4b9a-ae31-2e2d22a02a32';
```

## Environment-Specific Issues

### Development vs Production
- Ensure Umami configuration works in both environments
- Check if localhost is properly configured for development testing

### CDN/Proxy Issues
- If using CDN/proxy in front of analytics.readysetllc.com
- Ensure proper forwarding of tracking requests
- Check for request transformation issues
