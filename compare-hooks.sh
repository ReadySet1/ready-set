echo "‚öñÔ∏è  RECOMMENDATION:"
echo ""
echo "  Current setup is very permissive - good for rapid development"
echo "  but may let bugs slip through to production."
echo ""
echo "  Enhanced setup provides safety net while staying fast enough"
echo "  for daily development workflow."

echo "  üéØ Suggested approach:"
echo "     1. Start with enhanced pre-commit (catches most issues early)"
echo "     2. Enable enhanced pre-push for critical branches"
echo "     3. Use PR template for all PRs to main"
echo "     4. Run full deploy:pre-checks before production deploys"
