 to use the new hook
6. Deploy with proper environment variables

## Environment Variables

Ensure these are properly configured:

```env
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
DIRECT_URL=your_direct_database_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run only dashboard metrics tests
pnpm test dashboard-metrics

# Run with coverage
pnpm test:coverage
```

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Review and update database indexes
- [ ] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Verify role-based access control
- [ ] Check error handling in production mode
- [ ] Monitor initial performance metrics
- [ ] Set up alerts for slow queries
- [ ] Verify cache headers are working
- [ ] Test rate limiting (if implemented)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**
   - Verify Supabase configuration
   - Check session handling
   - Ensure cookies are being sent

2. **Permission Errors**
   - Verify user profile type is set correctly
   - Check role-based logic

3. **Slow Performance**
   - Check database indexes
   - Monitor query execution plans
   - Consider implementing caching

4. **Type Errors**
   - Ensure Prisma client is generated
   - Update TypeScript definitions
   - Check for version mismatches

## Code Quality

The improved code follows these best practices:

- ✅ SOLID principles
- ✅ DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- ✅ Error boundaries
- ✅ Proper TypeScript usage
- ✅ Comprehensive testing
- ✅ Performance monitoring
- ✅ Security best practices
- ✅ Clean code architecture

## Summary

The dashboard metrics API has been significantly improved with:

1. **Better Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces
2. **Enhanced Security**: Authentication, authorization, and input validation
3. **Improved Performance**: Parallel queries, caching, and monitoring
4. **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and user-friendly messages
5. **Maintainability**: Clean code structure, tests, and documentation
6. **Developer Experience**: Custom React hook and reusable utilities

These improvements make the API more robust, secure, and maintainable while providing a better developer experience for the frontend team.
