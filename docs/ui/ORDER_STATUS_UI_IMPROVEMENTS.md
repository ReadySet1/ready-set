# Order Status Page UI Improvements

## Overview

This document summarizes the UI improvements made to the order status page to create a cleaner, more user-friendly interface by removing unnecessary elements and improving visual spacing.

## Changes Made

### 1. Logo Title Simplification

**File Modified:** `src/components/Header/Logo.tsx`

- **Change:** Updated logo source from old logo files to `new-logo-ready-set.png`
- **Impact:** Removed "Catering Request" text from the logo, displaying only "ready set" with the bird icon
- **Benefit:** Cleaner, more professional appearance in the navigation bar

### 2. Page Title Optimization

**File Modified:** `src/components/Orders/SingleOrder.tsx`

- **Change:** Replaced dynamic title logic that showed "Catering Request" or "On-Demand Order" with a simple "Order {orderNumber}" format
- **Impact:** Consistent title display showing "Order SF-56780" instead of "Catering Request"
- **Benefit:** More direct and informative page title

### 3. Visual Spacing Improvement

**File Modified:** `src/components/Orders/SingleOrder.tsx`

- **Change:** Added `mt-20` class to the title section
- **Impact:** Increased top margin to create better visual separation between header and page title
- **Benefit:** Less crowded appearance, improved readability

### 4. Status Management Simplification

**File Modified:** `src/components/Orders/OrderStatus.tsx`

- **Change:** Removed the entire "Change Status" section including:
  - "Change Status:" label
  - Status dropdown menu
  - Status change functionality
- **Impact:** Simplified the status display to show only current status
- **Benefit:** Cleaner interface focused on information display rather than editing

### 5. Driver Status Control Removal

**File Modified:** `src/components/Orders/DriverStatus.tsx`

- **Change:** Removed the "Update Status" button and associated dropdown menu
- **Impact:** Eliminated driver status modification controls from the user interface
- **Benefit:** Streamlined driver status display without editing capabilities
