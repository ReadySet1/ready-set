- Not username or email

#### Test 3.3: Regular User Display Name

**Objective**: Verify regular users see their username
**Steps**:

1. Sign in as regular user
2. Check header display name
3. Verify username is displayed

**Expected Results**:

- Header should display username for regular users
- Not role-based name

### 4. Role Validation & Recovery Tests

#### Test 4.1: Automatic Role Correction

**Objective**: Verify system automatically corrects role mismatches
**Steps**:

1. Manually change user role in database to incorrect value
2. Sign in as user
3. Navigate to appropriate dashboard
4. Verify role is automatically corrected

**Expected Results**:

- System should detect role mismatch
- Role should be automatically corrected
- User should be redirected to correct dashboard

#### Test 4.2: Role Recovery on Failure

**Objective**: Verify system recovers from role fetch failures
**Steps**:

1. Simulate database connection issues
2. Sign in as user
3. Verify system attempts role recovery
4. Verify fallback role is used if recovery fails

**Expected Results**:

- System should attempt multiple recovery strategies
- Fallback role should be used if all strategies fail
- User should still be able to access appropriate dashboard

#### Test 4.3: Error Recovery Mechanism

**Objective**: Verify error recovery provides user feedback
**Steps**:

1. Simulate various error conditions
2. Verify appropriate error messages are shown
3. Verify recovery mechanisms are triggered

**Expected Results**:

- User-friendly error messages should be displayed
- Recovery mechanisms should be triggered automatically
- System should attempt to resolve issues

### 5. Performance Tests

#### Test 5.1: Authentication Speed

**Objective**: Verify authentication is fast and responsive
**Steps**:

1. Measure time to complete Google OAuth flow
2. Measure time to load dashboard after authentication
