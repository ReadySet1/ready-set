- **Carrier Dashboard** - Admin interface at `/admin/carriers` for monitoring and managing carrier integrations
- **Detailed Carrier Pages** - Individual carrier details with statistics, configuration, and webhook settings
- **Webhook Logs** - Placeholder interface for tracking webhook delivery and troubleshooting (backend implementation pending)

### Architecture
- **Carrier Service** (`src/lib/services/carrierService.ts`) - Core service for carrier operations
- **Admin API** - RESTful API endpoints for carrier statistics and management
- **Carrier Components** - React components for carrier overview, details, and summary widgets

### Supported Carriers
- **CaterValley** - Full integration with automated order status synchronization
- **Extensible Design** - Easy addition of new carriers through configuration

## üîê Security

### Authentication
- **Supabase Auth** for secure user authentication
- **Email/Password authentication** with secure password hashing
- **Google OAuth integration** for social login
- **Magic link authentication** for passwordless login
- **Session management** with secure JWT tokens
- **Role-based access control** (CLIENT, ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN, DRIVER, VENDOR, HELPDESK)
- **Protected routes** with middleware-based authorization

### XSS Prevention
- **DOMPurify sanitization** for all user-generated HTML content
- **Input sanitization utilities** in `src/lib/security/sanitize.ts`
- **Comprehensive test coverage** for XSS attack vectors
- Protection against script injection, event handlers, and malicious URLs

## üîß Development

- **Automated testing** with Vitest and Playwright
- **Code quality** with ESLint and Prettier
- **Git hooks** for pre-push validation

## üö´ CI/CD Status - Workflows Disabled

**As of August 18, 2025, all GitHub Actions workflows have been archived as part of our CI/CD optimization initiative.**

### üìÅ Current State
- **GitHub Actions:** All workflows moved to archive
- **CI/CD Process:** Manual deployment process
- **Testing:** Local testing with `pnpm test` and `pnpm test:e2e`
- **Build Process:** Manual build with `pnpm build`

### üîÑ How to Re-enable Workflows
If you need to restore CI/CD functionality:

1. **Quick Re-enable (Individual Workflow):**
   ```bash
   # Copy workflow from archive to active directory
   cp .github/workflows-archive/ci.yml .github/workflows/
   
   # Remove any "if: false" conditions from the workflow file
   # Commit and push changes
   ```

2. **Full Restore (All Workflows):**
   ```bash
   # Restore all workflows at once
   cp -r .github/workflows-archive/*.yml .github/workflows/
   
   # Commit and push changes
   ```

3. **Selective Restore:**
   - Copy specific workflows as needed
   - Configure required secrets and environment variables
   - Each workflow can be re-enabled independently

### üìö Archive Documentation
- **Archive Location:** `.github/workflows-archive/`
- **Master Plan:** `GITHUB_WORKFLOWS_ARCHIVE_PLAN.md`
- **Detailed Specifications:** `.github/workflows-archive/MANIFEST.md`
- **Re-enabling Guide:** `.github/workflows-archive/README.md`

### üéØ Why Workflows Were Disabled
- **Resource Optimization:** Reduce GitHub Actions minutes consumption
- **Development Focus:** Prioritize feature development over automated workflows
- **Maintenance Simplification:** Streamline deployment processes
- **Project Transition:** Moving to new CI/CD strategy

### üö® Important Notes
- **All workflows are safely preserved** with complete functionality
- **No data or configuration has been lost**
- **Recovery is always possible** using the archive system
- **Secrets and environment variables** are documented for easy reconfiguration
