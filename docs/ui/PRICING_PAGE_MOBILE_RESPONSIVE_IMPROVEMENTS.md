## Responsive Breakpoints Used

Following Tailwind's default breakpoints:

- **Mobile**: `< 640px` (default, no prefix)
- **Small**: `sm: 640px` - tablets in portrait
- **Medium**: `md: 768px` - tablets in landscape, small laptops
- **Large**: `lg: 1024px` - desktops
- **Extra Large**: `xl: 1280px` - large desktops

## Key Principles Applied

1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with compact mobile design, scale up for larger screens
2. **Reduced Padding**: Less whitespace on mobile to maximize content area
3. **Smaller Typography**: Text sizes scale with screen size while maintaining readability
4. **Abbreviated Labels**: Shorter text on mobile where appropriate (table headers, button labels)
5. **Flexible Spacing**: Using responsive spacing utilities (sm:mb-4, md:mb-6, etc.)
6. **Icon Scaling**: Icons resize proportionally with their containers

## Testing Recommendations

Test on multiple devices and breakpoints:

- iPhone SE (375px) - smallest modern phone
- iPhone 12/13/14 (390px)
- iPhone Pro Max (428px)
- iPad Mini (768px)
- iPad (820px)
- Desktop (1024px+)

## File Modified

- `src/components/Pricing/ModernPricingLandingPage.tsx`

## Result

The page now displays comfortably on mobile devices without feeling crowded, while maintaining the modern, professional appearance on larger screens. All text remains readable, and spacing is optimized for each breakpoint.
