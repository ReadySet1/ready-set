# Client Dashboard Navigation Tests

This test suite verifies that the navigation links on the client dashboard work correctly, specifically focusing on the "New Order" links that should redirect to the catering request page.

## Test Coverage

### Core Navigation Tests

- ✅ **"New Order" link in Quick Actions**: Verifies the link points to `/catering-request`
- ✅ **"Place Your First Order" link**: Verifies the link points to `/catering-request` when no orders exist
- ✅ **Other navigation links**: Verifies all other quick action links have correct href attributes
- ✅ **Link text and descriptions**: Verifies proper text and descriptions are displayed

### Component Rendering Tests

- ✅ **Page title and description**: Verifies correct breadcrumb and page information
- ✅ **Welcome message**: Verifies user-specific welcome message
- ✅ **Dashboard sections**: Verifies all major sections render correctly
- ✅ **Recent orders**: Verifies order information displays correctly
- ✅ **Authentication handling**: Verifies redirect behavior for unauthenticated users

## Test Structure

The test file is organized into two main test suites:

1. **Client Dashboard Navigation Link Tests**: Tests the overall component rendering and basic functionality
2. **Client Dashboard Link Functionality - Core Navigation Tests**: Focuses specifically on link href attributes and navigation

## Key Test Scenarios

### Fixed Navigation Issue

The primary issue that was fixed:

- **Before**: "New Order" links pointed to `/client/orders/new` (broken)
- **After**: "New Order" links point to `/catering-request` (working)

### Test Cases Covered

1. **Normal state**: When user has orders, "New Order" link in Quick Actions works
2. **Empty state**: When user has no orders, "Place Your First Order" link works
3. **All other links**: Manage Addresses, Update Profile, Contact Us, View All orders
4. **Authentication**: Proper redirect for unauthenticated users

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run only the client dashboard tests
pnpm test src/__tests__/components/ClientDashboard/ClientDashboard.test.tsx

# Run all tests
pnpm test
```

## Mocking Strategy

The tests use comprehensive mocking to isolate the component:

- **Next.js navigation**: Mocked to avoid actual navigation
- **Authentication**: Mocked user data and authentication checks
- **Prisma database**: Mocked to return test data
- **Components**: Mocked complex dependencies like Breadcrumb

## Expected Results

All 15 tests should pass, verifying that:

- ✅ Navigation links have correct href attributes
- ✅ Component renders correctly with test data
- ✅ Authentication flow works as expected
- ✅ Both "New Order" links point to the correct catering request page

## Notes

- The tests focus on **href attributes** rather than actual navigation clicks since we're testing a server component
- React 18 warnings in the console are expected and don't affect test functionality
- The test data matches the screenshot scenario with order "TEST 00126" and $600.00 total
