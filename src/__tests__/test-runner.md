# Catering Request and Address Manager Test Suite

This test suite verifies that the infinite loop issues in the Catering Request Form and Address Manager components have been successfully resolved.

## 🎯 Test Objectives

### 1. **Infinite Loop Prevention** ✅

- Verify that AddressManager doesn't make excessive API calls on mount
- Ensure no infinite re-renders occur when addresses are loaded
- Test that filter and pagination changes don't trigger loops

### 2. **Component Integration** ✅

- Test that CateringRequestForm and AddressManager work together properly
- Verify address loading callbacks are handled correctly
- Ensure form state is maintained during address loading

### 3. **Performance & Memory** ✅

- Test that components don't cause excessive re-renders
- Verify no memory leaks occur with multiple renders/unmounts
- Ensure debouncing works properly for rapid changes

## 🧪 Test Files

### `AddressManager.test.tsx`

Tests the AddressManager component in isolation:

- Infinite loop prevention
- Address loading functionality
- Error handling
- Filter and pagination
- Performance and memory management

### `CateringRequestForm.test.tsx`

Tests the CateringRequestForm component:

- Form rendering and validation
- Address integration
- Form state management
- Error handling
- Performance characteristics

### `CateringRequestIntegration.test.tsx`

Integration tests for both components working together:

- Address loading for both pickup and delivery
- Form state maintenance during address loading
- Real-world usage simulation
- Performance under load

## 🚀 Running Tests

### Option 1: Run All Tests

```bash
# From project root
./src/__tests__/run-catering-tests.sh
```

### Option 2: Run Individual Test Files

```bash
# Test AddressManager only
pnpm test src/__tests__/AddressManager.test.tsx

# Test CateringRequestForm only
pnpm test src/__tests__/CateringRequestForm.test.tsx

# Test integration
pnpm test src/__tests__/CateringRequestIntegration.test.tsx
```

### Option 3: Run Specific Test Cases

```bash
# Test infinite loop prevention specifically
pnpm test src/__tests__/AddressManager.test.tsx -- --grep "should not make excessive API calls"

# Test performance
pnpm test src/__tests__/CateringRequestIntegration.test.tsx -- --grep "should not cause re-renders"
```

## 🔍 What the Tests Verify

### ✅ **Infinite Loop Fix Verification**

- **Before Fix**: Components would make excessive API calls and cause infinite re-renders
- **After Fix**: Components make exactly one API call per instance and render efficiently

### ✅ **State Update Fix Verification**

- **Before Fix**: React errors about updating components during render
- **After Fix**: State updates happen at the right time using `setTimeout` to defer callbacks

### ✅ **Hydration Fix Verification**

- **Before Fix**: Server/client HTML mismatches causing hydration errors
- **After Fix**: Consistent rendering between server and client with proper hydration guards

### ✅ **Performance Verification**

- **Before Fix**: Excessive re-renders and memory leaks
- **After Fix**: Stable rendering with proper debouncing and cleanup

## 📊 Expected Test Results

When all tests pass, you should see:

```
🎉 All tests completed successfully!
==================================================
✅ TypeScript compilation: PASSED

✅ CateringRequestForm component: PASSED
✅ Integration tests: PASSED
✅ Infinite loop prevention: PASSED
✅ Performance tests: PASSED
✅ Memory leak prevention: PASSED

🎯 The infinite loop issue has been successfully fixed!
🔧 Both components now work together without performance issues.
📱 Addresses load properly without excessive API calls.
⚡ Form state is maintained during address loading.
🚀 Ready for production use!
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Tests Fail

1. **Check TypeScript compilation**:

   ```bash
   pnpm run type-check
   ```

2. **Verify dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Check test environment**:

   ```bash
   pnpm test --version
   ```

4. **Run tests with verbose output**:
   ```bash
   pnpm test src/__tests__/AddressManager.test.tsx -- --verbose
   ```

### Common Issues

- **Mock failures**: Ensure all required mocks are properly configured
- **Timing issues**: Some tests use `setTimeout` - adjust timing if needed
- **Environment differences**: Tests run in Node.js, not browser environment

## 🔧 Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests

When adding new features to these components:

1. Add corresponding test cases to the appropriate test file
2. Ensure new tests follow the same pattern and naming convention
3. Update this documentation if new test categories are added

### Updating Mocks

If component dependencies change:

1. Update the mock implementations in the test files
2. Ensure mocks accurately reflect the real component behavior
3. Test that mocks don't interfere with the actual test logic

## 📈 Performance Benchmarks

The tests include performance assertions:

- **Render count**: Should be less than 10 renders per component lifecycle
- **API calls**: Should be exactly 2 calls (one per AddressManager instance)
- **Memory**: Should not leak memory with multiple mount/unmount cycles
- **Debouncing**: Should prevent excessive API calls during rapid changes

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Tests are considered successful when:

1. ✅ All test cases pass without errors
2. ✅ No infinite loops or excessive API calls
3. ✅ Components render efficiently (render count < 10)
4. ✅ Memory usage remains stable
5. ✅ Integration between components works smoothly
6. ✅ Error handling works correctly
7. ✅ Performance meets benchmarks

## 🚀 Next Steps

After all tests pass:

1. **Deploy to staging** for real-world testing
2. **Monitor performance** in production environment
3. **Add end-to-end tests** for complete user workflows
4. **Consider adding load testing** for high-traffic scenarios
