# Linear Issue: Fix Order Status Page UI - Remove Catering Request Title & Simplify Interface

## Issue Details

**Title:** Fix Order Status Page UI - Remove Catering Request Title & Simplify Interface  
**Type:** UI/UX Improvement  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Labels:** `ui-fix`, `hotfix`, `ready-for-review`  
**Status:** Done

## Description

Order status page had cluttered interface with unnecessary "Catering Request" branding and status editing controls that created poor user experience.

### Problem

- Logo displayed "Catering Request ready set" creating visual clutter
- Page title showed "Catering Request" instead of order-specific information
- Crowded layout with title too close to header
- Multiple status editing options (Change Status dropdown, Update Status button) cluttering interface
- Inconsistent branding across pages

### Expected Behavior

- Clean logo with only "ready set" branding
- Clear page title showing "Order {orderNumber}"
- Proper visual spacing between elements
- Simplified, read-only interface focused on information display

## Solution Implemented

✅ **Logo Simplification** - Updated logo source to `new-logo-ready-set.png`  
✅ **Page Title Optimization** - Changed to "Order {orderNumber}" format  
✅ **Visual Spacing** - Added `mt-20` for better header separation  
✅ **Status Management Cleanup** - Removed "Change Status" dropdown  
✅ **Driver Controls Removal** - Removed "Update Status" button

## Files Modified

- `src/components/Header/Logo.tsx` - Logo source update
- `src/components/Orders/SingleOrder.tsx` - Title & spacing improvements
- `src/components/Orders/OrderStatus.tsx` - Status management simplification
- `src/components/Orders/DriverStatus.tsx` - Driver status control removal

## Testing Results

### Test Cases Verified
