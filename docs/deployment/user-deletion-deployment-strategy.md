- [ ] Memory usage and leak detection alerts
- [ ] Audit log monitoring for unusual patterns

**Production Deployment Process**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Production deployment process
echo "üè≠ PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT"

# Pre-deployment checks
./scripts/pre-deployment-checks.sh

# Database backup
./scripts/backup-production-db.sh

# Deploy with feature flag disabled
./scripts/deploy-with-feature-flag.sh --flag=user-deletion --enabled=false

# Run production smoke tests
./scripts/production-smoke-tests.sh

# Gradual rollout
./scripts/gradual-rollout.sh --feature=user-deletion --percentage=5

echo "‚úÖ Production deployment initiated"
```

# Restore database if necessary (use with extreme caution)
# ./scripts/restore-database.sh --backup-file=pre-deployment-backup.sql
