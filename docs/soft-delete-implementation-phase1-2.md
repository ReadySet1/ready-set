# Soft Delete Implementation - Phases 1 & 2 Complete

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the first two phases of the soft delete master plan for users in the Ready Set project.

## Phase 1: Database Schema Updates ✅

### 1.1 Schema Verification

- ✅ **Verified existing schema**: The `deletedAt` field already exists in the Profile model (`DateTime? @db.Timestamptz(6)`)
- ✅ **Confirmed field type**: Uses PostgreSQL `TIMESTAMPTZ(6)` for precise timestamp storage

### 1.2 Performance Optimization Migration

**Migration**: `20250905002310_add_soft_delete_indexes`

**Indexes Added**:

- `profiles_deleted_at_type_status_idx`: Composite index on `(deletedAt, type, status)` for filtered queries
- `profiles_active_users_idx`: Partial index for non-deleted users (`WHERE deletedAt IS NULL`)
- `addresses_deleted_at_idx`: Index for soft delete queries on addresses
- `catering_requests_deleted_at_idx`: Index for soft delete queries on catering requests
- `on_demand_requests_deleted_at_idx`: Index for soft delete queries on on-demand requests
- `job_applications_deleted_at_idx`: Index for soft delete queries on job applications

**Performance Benefits**:

- Optimized queries filtering by deletion status
- Faster retrieval of active users
- Improved performance for soft delete operations across all models

## Phase 2: Prisma Schema Enhancement ✅

### 2.1 Profile Model Updates

**New Fields Added**:

- `deletedBy`: `String? @db.Uuid` - Reference to user who performed the deletion
- `deletionReason`: `String?` - Optional field for audit trail

**Relations Added**:

- `deletedByUser`: Self-referencing relation to track who deleted the user
- `deletedUsers`: Reverse relation for users deleted by this user
- `auditLogs`: Relation to UserAudit records for this user
- `performedAudits`: Relation to UserAudit records performed by this user

**Indexes Added**:

- `@@index([deletedAt])`: For soft delete queries
- `@@index([deletedBy])`: For tracking who deleted users

### 2.2 UserAudit Model Creation

**New Model**: `UserAudit`

**Fields**:

- `id`: Primary key (UUID)
- `userId`: Reference to the user being audited
- `action`: Type of action (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, RESTORE, etc.)
- `performedBy`: Reference to user who performed the action
- `changes`: JSON field storing before/after values
- `reason`: Optional reason for the action
- `metadata`: Additional metadata (JSON)
- `createdAt`: Timestamp of the action

**Relations**:

- `user`: Reference to the audited user
- `performer`: Reference to the user who performed the action

**Indexes**:

- `@@index([userId])`: For querying user's audit history
- `@@index([action])`: For filtering by action type
- `@@index([performedBy])`: For tracking actions by specific users
- `@@index([createdAt])`: For time-based queries

## Migration Files Created

### 1. Performance Indexes Migration

**File**: `prisma/migrations/20250905002310_add_soft_delete_indexes/migration.sql`

- Adds performance optimization indexes
- Uses `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` for zero-downtime deployment
- Covers all models with soft delete functionality

### 2. Schema Changes Migration

**File**: `prisma/migrations/20250905002403_add_soft_delete_fields_and_audit_model/migration.sql`

- Adds `deletedBy` and `deletionReason` fields to profiles table
- Creates `user_audits` table with proper constraints
- Adds foreign key relationships and indexes
- Uses `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` for performance

## Database Schema Changes

### Profiles Table

```sql
-- New columns added
ALTER TABLE "profiles" ADD COLUMN "deletedBy" UUID;
ALTER TABLE "profiles" ADD COLUMN "deletionReason" TEXT;

-- Foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE "profiles" ADD CONSTRAINT "profiles_deletedBy_fkey"
FOREIGN KEY ("deletedBy") REFERENCES "profiles"("id") ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE;
```

### User Audits Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE "user_audits" (
    "id" UUID NOT NULL,
    "userId" UUID NOT NULL,
    "action" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "performedBy" UUID,
    "changes" JSONB,
    "reason" TEXT,
    "metadata" JSONB,
    "createdAt" TIMESTAMPTZ(6) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    CONSTRAINT "user_audits_pkey" PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);
```

## Next Steps

The foundation for soft delete functionality is now in place. The next phases would typically include:

1. **Phase 3**: Service Layer Implementation
2. **Phase 4**: API Endpoint Updates
3. **Phase 5**: Frontend Integration
4. **Phase 6**: Testing and Validation
5. **Phase 7**: Documentation and Deployment

## Technical Notes

### Performance Considerations

- All indexes use `CONCURRENTLY` for zero-downtime deployment
- Partial indexes optimize queries for active users
- Composite indexes support complex filtering scenarios

### Data Integrity

- Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity
- Cascade deletes maintain data consistency
- Optional fields allow for gradual implementation

### Audit Trail

- Comprehensive tracking of all user modifications
- JSON fields provide flexibility for different change types
- Timestamped records for compliance and debugging

## Files Modified
