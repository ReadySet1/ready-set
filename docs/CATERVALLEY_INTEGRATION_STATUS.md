# CaterValley Integration Status Report - UPDATED

## üö® URGENT STATUS: FINANCIAL PRIORITY INTEGRATION

**Date:** December 2024  
**Integration Version:** 2.0.0 - MAJOR UPDATE  
**Status:** UPDATED FOR FINANCIAL COMPLIANCE  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Integration must go live this week

## üî• CRITICAL BUSINESS CONTEXT

**CaterValley is currently operating at a loss on deliveries** where their customer pricing doesn't match Ready Set's fees. This integration completion is critical for:

- **Stopping financial losses** on delivery operations
- **Proper pricing alignment** between CaterValley customer charges and Ready Set fees
- **Operational stability** for both companies

### Example Loss Scenario (from business requirements):
- Route: 303 Almaden Blvd to 2855 Campus Dr (33.86 miles)
- CaterValley was charging: Standard rate
- Actual cost with new pricing: $221.41
- **Current loss: $(71.41) per delivery**

## ‚úÖ MAJOR UPDATES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. NEW DISTANCE-BASED PRICING STRUCTURE

The pricing system has been completely rewritten to match the new requirements:

#### Distance Tiers:
- **Standard Delivery (0-10 miles)**: Base pricing structure
- **Over 10 Miles Delivery**: Increased rates (e.g., >25 headcount = $71.59 with tip)
- **Over 30 Miles Delivery**: Premium rates (e.g., >25 headcount = $75.00)

#### Head Count & Food Cost Tiers:
| Head Count | Food Cost | Standard (0-10mi) | Over 10mi | Over 30mi |
|------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|
| >25 | >$300 | $35.00/$42.50* | $71.59/$85.00 | $75.00/$90.00 |
| 25-49 | $300-599 | $45.00/$52.50 | $90.00/$105.00 | $95.00/$110.00 |
| 50-74 | $600-899 | $55.00/$62.50 | $110.00/$125.00 | $115.00/$130.00 |
| 75-99 | $900-1199 | $65.00/$72.50 | $130.00/$145.00 | $135.00/$150.00 |
| 100+ | $1200+ | 9%/10% of Food Cost | 18%/20% of Food Cost | 20%/22% of Food Cost |

*Format: with tip/without tip

### 2. REAL DISTANCE CALCULATION

- **Google Maps Integration**: Real distance calculation using Google Maps Distance Matrix API
- **Fallback System**: Intelligent city-based estimation when API unavailable
- **Accurate Pricing**: Proper tier assignment based on actual miles

### 3. TIP HANDLING

- **Default**: Include tip in pricing (lower rates)
- **Option**: Without tip pricing available
- **Flexibility**: Can be configured per order
