# Linear Issue: UploadErrorDashboard TypeScript Declaration Order Fix

## Issue Details

**Title:** Fix 'used before declaration' TypeScript errors in UploadErrorDashboard
**Type:** Bug Fix
**Priority:** Medium
**Labels:** ui-fix, hotfix, ready-for-review
**Status:** Done

## Description

### Problem

- TypeScript compilation was failing with 4 errors in `UploadErrorDashboard.tsx`
- Functions `fetchErrors` and `calculateStats` were being used in hook dependency arrays before their declarations
- This created a temporal dead zone issue where functions were referenced before being declared
- The errors occurred after fixing previous react-hooks/exhaustive-deps warnings

### Expected Behavior

- All functions should be declared before they are used in dependency arrays
- TypeScript compilation should pass without errors
- Hook dependencies should be properly ordered to prevent temporal dead zone issues

### Solution Implemented

- Reordered function declarations within the `UploadErrorDashboard` component:
  1. `calculateStats` moved before `fetchErrors` (since it's used as a dependency)
  2. `fetchErrors` moved before `useEffect` (since it's used as a dependency)
  3. `useEffect` positioned after all function declarations
- This resolves the temporal dead zone without changing component functionality
- Maintained proper dependency relationships between hooks

## Files Modified

**File:** `src/components/Admin/UploadErrorDashboard.tsx`

- **Lines 44-101:** Reordered function declarations
- **Lines Added:** 0 (pure reordering)
- **Lines Removed:** 0 (pure reordering)
- **Net Change:** 0 lines (functionality preserved)

## Testing Results

### Test Cases Verified

- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes (`pnpm run type-check`)
- ✅ ESLint passes without warnings (`pnpm run lint`)
- ✅ Component functionality preserved (no behavioral changes)
- ✅ All hook dependencies properly resolved

### Metrics

- **Files Changed:** 1
- **Lines Added:** 0
- **Lines Removed:** 0
- **UI Complexity:** No change (pure refactoring)
- **User Experience:** No impact (internal fix)

## Workflow Updates

**Development Workflow:**

- Standard hotfix pattern followed
- TypeScript errors resolved without introducing new issues
- Code maintainability improved through proper declaration ordering

**Code Review Requirements:**

- Reviewed for proper hook dependency management
- Verified no functional changes to component behavior

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved
- ✅ Component compiles successfully
- ✅ Linting passes without warnings
- ✅ No regressions introduced
- ✅ Hook dependencies properly ordered

## Detailed Implementation Report

This was a targeted hotfix addressing TypeScript compilation errors caused by function declaration ordering. The solution follows React best practices for hook dependencies and maintains backward compatibility. The fix is minimal and focused, reducing risk of introducing new issues.

## Design Review: Ready for team review and approval

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Deploy to staging for integration testing
2. **Future:** Monitor for similar temporal dead zone issues in other components
3. **Maintenance:** Consider adding pre-commit hooks to catch declaration order issues
