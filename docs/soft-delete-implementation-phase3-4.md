# Soft Delete Implementation - Phases 3 & 4 Complete

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of phases 3 and 4 of the soft delete master plan for users in the Ready Set project, focusing on service layer implementation and API endpoint updates.

## Phase 3: Service Layer Implementation ✅

### 3.1 Soft Delete Service

**File**: `src/services/userSoftDeleteService.ts`

**Key Features**:

- **softDeleteUser()**: Soft deletes a user with audit logging
- **restoreUser()**: Restores a soft-deleted user
- **permanentlyDeleteUser()**: Permanently deletes for GDPR compliance
- **getDeletedUsers()**: Retrieves soft-deleted users with filtering
- **checkActiveOrders()**: Validates no active orders before deletion

**Interfaces**:

- `DeletedUserFilters`: Filtering options for deleted users
- `SoftDeleteResult`: Result of soft delete operation
- `RestoreResult`: Result of restore operation
- `PermanentDeleteResult`: Result of permanent delete operation

**Key Features**:

- Transaction-based operations for data consistency
- Comprehensive audit logging with before/after changes
- Active order validation before deletion
- Support for deletion reasons and metadata
- Pagination and filtering for deleted users list

### 3.2 User Service Enhancement

- **isUserActive()**: Check if user exists and is not soft-deleted
- **getUserStatistics()**: Comprehensive user statistics

**Key Features**:

- All queries exclude soft-deleted users by default
- Optional `includeDeleted` parameter for admin views
- Comprehensive filtering and pagination support
- Statistics include both active and deleted user counts

## Phase 4: API Endpoint Updates ✅

### 4.1 Modified DELETE Endpoint

**File**: `src/app/api/users/[userId]/route.ts`

**Changes**:

- **Soft Delete Implementation**: Changed from hard delete to soft delete
- **Deletion Reason Support**: Accepts optional reason in request body
- **Active Order Validation**: Prevents deletion of users with active orders
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of soft delete operations
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling for soft delete scenarios

**API Changes**:

- `DELETE /api/users/[userId]` now performs soft delete
- Request body can include `{ "reason": "deletion reason" }`
- Returns soft delete information (deletedAt, deletedBy, deletionReason)
- Maintains all existing security and validation checks

### 4.2 New Endpoints Created

#### Restore Endpoint

**File**: `src/app/api/users/[userId]/restore/route.ts`

- **Method**: POST
- **Access**: ADMIN and SUPER_ADMIN only
- **Function**: Restores soft-deleted users
- **Features**: Audit logging, validation, error handling

#### Deleted Users List Endpoint

**File**: `src/app/api/users/deleted/route.ts`

- **Method**: GET
- **Access**: ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN, and HELPDESK
- **Function**: Lists soft-deleted users with filtering
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `type`: Filter by user type
  - `status`: Filter by user status
  - `deletedBy`: Filter by who deleted the user
  - `deletedAfter`: Filter by deletion date (after)
  - `deletedBefore`: Filter by deletion date (before)
  - `search`: Search in name, email, contact name, company name
  - `page`: Page number for pagination
  - `limit`: Number of results per page

#### Permanent Deletion Endpoint

**File**: `src/app/api/users/[userId]/purge/route.ts`

- **Method**: DELETE
- **Access**: SUPER_ADMIN only
- **Function**: Permanently deletes users for GDPR compliance
- **Features**:
  - Double confirmation mechanism
  - Detailed reason requirement (minimum 10 characters)
  - Comprehensive audit logging
  - Affected records reporting

### 4.3 Updated Existing GET Endpoints

#### Users List Endpoint

**File**: `src/app/api/users/route.ts`

- **Enhancement**: Excludes soft-deleted users by default
- **Implementation**: Added `where.deletedAt = null` to all queries
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains existing API contract

#### Individual User Endpoint

**File**: `src/app/api/users/[userId]/route.ts`

- **GET Method**: Excludes soft-deleted users
- **PUT Method**: Prevents updates to soft-deleted users
- **PATCH Method**: Prevents updates to soft-deleted users
- **Error Handling**: Returns 404 for soft-deleted users in GET, 409 for updates

## API Endpoint Summary

### New Endpoints

1. **POST** `/api/users/[userId]/restore` - Restore soft-deleted user
2. **GET** `/api/users/deleted` - List soft-deleted users with filtering
3. **DELETE** `/api/users/[userId]/purge` - Permanently delete user

### Modified Endpoints

1. **DELETE** `/api/users/[userId]` - Now performs soft delete
2. **GET** `/api/users` - Excludes soft-deleted users
3. **GET** `/api/users/[userId]` - Excludes soft-deleted users
4. **PUT** `/api/users/[userId]` - Prevents updates to soft-deleted users
5. **PATCH** `/api/users/[userId]` - Prevents updates to soft-deleted users

## Security and Access Control

### Role-Based Access

- **SUPER_ADMIN**: Full access to all operations including permanent deletion
- **ADMIN**: Can soft delete, restore, and view deleted users
- **HELPDESK**: Can view deleted users but cannot delete or restore
- **Other Roles**: No access to soft delete functionality

### Validation and Safety

- **Active Order Check**: Prevents deletion of users with active orders
- **Self-Deletion Prevention**: Users cannot delete their own accounts
- **Super Admin Protection**: Super admins cannot be deleted
- **Confirmation Requirements**: Permanent deletion requires detailed confirmation
- **Audit Logging**: All operations are logged with full context

## Error Handling

### Soft Delete Errors

- `USER_NOT_FOUND`: User doesn't exist
- `ALREADY_DELETED`: User is already soft deleted
- `ACTIVE_ORDERS_EXIST`: User has active orders
- `SOFT_DELETE_FAILED`: General soft delete failure

### Restore Errors

- `NOT_SOFT_DELETED`: User is not soft deleted
- `USER_NOT_FOUND`: User doesn't exist
- `RESTORE_FAILED`: General restore failure

### Permanent Delete Errors

- `NOT_SOFT_DELETED`: User must be soft deleted first
- `SUPER_ADMIN_PROTECTED`: Super admins cannot be permanently deleted
- `USER_NOT_FOUND`: User doesn't exist
- `PERMANENT_DELETE_FAILED`: General permanent delete failure

## Data Flow

### Soft Delete Process

1. Validate user exists and is not already deleted
2. Check for active orders
3. Update user with `deletedAt`, `deletedBy`, `deletionReason`
4. Create audit log entry
5. Return success response

### Restore Process

1. Validate user exists and is soft deleted
2. Clear soft delete fields (`deletedAt`, `deletedBy`, `deletionReason`)
3. Create audit log entry
4. Return success response

### Permanent Delete Process

1. Validate user exists and is soft deleted
2. Check user is not super admin
3. Require detailed confirmation
4. Perform hard delete with cascade cleanup
5. Create comprehensive audit log
6. Return success response with affected records

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization

- All queries use proper indexes for soft delete filtering
- Pagination implemented for large result sets
- Efficient filtering with proper WHERE clauses
- Transaction-based operations for consistency

### Caching Strategy

- User statistics can be cached
- Deleted users list supports pagination
- Active user counts are optimized

- `src/services/userService.ts` - Enhanced user service
- `src/app/api/users/[userId]/restore/route.ts` - Restore endpoint
- `src/app/api/users/deleted/route.ts` - Deleted users list endpoint
- `src/app/api/users/[userId]/purge/route.ts` - Permanent deletion endpoint

### Modified Files

- `src/app/api/users/route.ts` - Updated GET method to exclude soft-deleted users

## Testing Recommendations
