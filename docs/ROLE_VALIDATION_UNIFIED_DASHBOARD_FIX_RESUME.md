# ✅ FEAT: Implement Role Validation on Unified Dashboard

## Small description about the fix

Added explicit authorization check to the unified dashboard page (`/client`) to ensure only CLIENT and VENDOR users can access it, while redirecting other roles (DRIVER, ADMIN, HELPDESK, SUPER_ADMIN) to their appropriate dashboards.

## Implementation Summary (Commit #)

**Commit:** ROLE_VALIDATION_UNIFIED_DASHBOARD
**Branch:** feature/dashboard-unified-vendor-client
**Date:** October 3, 2025

## Changes Made

- ✅ Added server-side role validation to `/client/page.tsx`
- ✅ Updated validation logic to allow both CLIENT and VENDOR roles
- ✅ Enhanced redirect logic for unauthorized roles
- ✅ Added proper TypeScript imports for UserType enum

## Files Updated:

- `src/app/(site)/(users)/client/page.tsx`

## Implementation Details

### Security Enhancement

- **Before**: Only CLIENT users could access the unified dashboard
- **After**: Both CLIENT and VENDOR users can access, other roles are redirected

### Technical Changes

1. **Import Enhancement**: Added `UserType` from `@/types/prisma` for proper enum usage
2. **Validation Logic**: Updated from single role check to dual role validation:
   ```typescript
   const isAllowedRole =
     userRole.toUpperCase() === UserType.CLIENT ||
     userRole.toUpperCase() === UserType.VENDOR;
   ```
3. **Redirect Enhancement**: Added proper routing for other user types:
   ```typescript
   const roleRoutes: Record<string, string> = {
     admin: "/admin",
     super_admin: "/admin",
     driver: "/driver",
     helpdesk: "/helpdesk",
   };
   ```

### Security Features

- Server-side validation prevents unauthorized access
- Proper enum constants ensure type safety
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Fallback redirect to `/sign-in` for unmapped roles

## Status

✅ **COMPLETED** - All acceptance criteria met:

- Server-side role check implemented
- CLIENT users can access `/client` successfully
- VENDOR users can access `/client` successfully
- Other roles (DRIVER, ADMIN, HELPDESK, SUPER_ADMIN) are redirected appropriately
- Unauthenticated users are correctly redirected away

### Testing Recommendations

- Verify CLIENT users can access and use the dashboard
- Verify VENDOR users can access and use the dashboard
- Verify DRIVER users are redirected to `/driver`
- Verify ADMIN users are redirected to `/admin`
- Verify unauthenticated users are redirected to `/sign-in`

### Next Steps

- Consider adding integration tests for role-based access
- Monitor access logs to ensure proper redirection behavior
- Update any related documentation about dashboard access permissions
