## 🚨 Recovery Procedures

### Quick Re-enable Workflow:

```bash
# Remove the "if: false" line from any workflow file
# Example: Remove line 23 from deploy-production.yml
# if: false  # ← Remove this line
```

### Full Restore from Backup:

```bash
# Copy all workflows back from backup
cp -r backups/github-workflows-20250818-145058/* .github/workflows/
```

### Selective Re-enable:

```bash
# Re-enable specific workflows by removing their "if: false" lines
# Each workflow has clear comments indicating how to re-enable
```
