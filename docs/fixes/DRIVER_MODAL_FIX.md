**Priority:** High  
**Labels:** `ui-fix`, `hotfix`, `ready-for-review`, `admin-dashboard`  
**Status:** Done

## Description

Driver assignment modal on admin dashboard had critical UI issues preventing users from completing driver assignments. Modal footer buttons were hidden due to CSS layout problems, making the interface unusable.

### Problem

- "Assign Driver" and "Cancel" buttons completely hidden in modal footer
- Modal content overflow issues cutting off essential UI elements
- Poor user experience preventing driver assignments
- Layout not responsive on different screen sizes
- Users unable to complete critical workflow

### Expected Behavior

- All modal buttons visible and accessible
- Proper scrolling when content exceeds modal height
- Responsive layout across all screen sizes
- Clear visual hierarchy with footer always visible
- Smooth user interaction flow

## Solution Implemented

✅ **CSS Layout Fix** - Changed `overflow-hidden` to `overflow-y-auto` for proper scrolling  
✅ **Flexbox Structure** - Added `flex flex-col` to DialogContent for proper layout  
✅ **Footer Positioning** - Added `mt-auto` to DialogFooter for consistent bottom placement  
✅ **Content Scrolling** - Added `flex-1 overflow-y-auto` to main content area  
✅ **Responsive Design** - Maintained mobile-first approach with proper spacing

## Files Modified

- `src/components/Orders/ui/DriverAssignmentDialog.tsx` - Modal layout improvements
- `src/components/Orders/SingleOrder.tsx` - Dialog state management
