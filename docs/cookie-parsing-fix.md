# Cookie Parsing Error Fix

## Problem Description

The application was experiencing an error with cookie parsing, specifically:

```
Failed to parse cookie string: SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'b', "base64-eyJ"..." is not valid JSON
```

This was occurring because Supabase stores session information in cookies that begin with `base64-`, but the middleware was incorrectly attempting to parse these cookies as JSON.

## Solution Implemented

We implemented several changes to fix this issue:

1. **Updated the middleware implementation**: Modified the middleware to use the recommended Supabase pattern for handling cookies in Next.js App Router applications.

2. **Enhanced error handling**: Added specific error handling to detect cookie parsing errors and redirect users to a recovery page.

3. **Created an AuthErrorRecovery component**: This component helps users recover from authentication errors by clearing problematic cookies and attempting to re-establish a session.

4. **Added a withAuthErrorHandler HOC**: This higher-order component detects cookie parsing errors during rendering and automatically shows the recovery UI.

5. **Improved cookie clearing utilities**: Enhanced the cookie clearing functions to handle all possible Supabase-related cookies across different domains and paths.

## Key Files Changed

- `src/middleware.ts`: Updated middleware implementation
- `src/utils/supabase/middleware.ts`: Improved Supabase cookie handling
- `src/utils/supabase/server.ts`: Updated server-side Supabase client
- `src/utils/supabase/client.ts`: Enhanced client-side cookie management
- `src/components/Auth/SignIn/AuthErrorRecovery.tsx`: Recovery component for auth errors
- `src/components/Auth/withAuthErrorHandler.tsx`: HOC to detect and handle auth errors
- `src/app/(site)/(auth)/sign-in/page.tsx`: Updated to show recovery UI when needed

## How It Works

1. When a cookie parsing error is detected, either in middleware or during component rendering, we redirect to the sign-in page with a `cookieError=true` parameter.

2. The sign-in page detects this parameter and shows the recovery UI instead of the normal login form.

3. The recovery UI provides options to:
   - Clear cookies and try to recover the session automatically
   - Go to the sign-in page to log in again

4. The `withAuthErrorHandler` HOC can be applied to any component that requires authentication to automatically detect and handle cookie parsing errors.

## Preventing Future Issues

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Follow the recommended Supabase patterns for cookie handling in Next.js applications
2. Use the `withAuthErrorHandler` HOC for sensitive authenticated components
3. Implement proper error boundaries around authentication-dependent code
4. Keep the Supabase client library updated to the latest version
