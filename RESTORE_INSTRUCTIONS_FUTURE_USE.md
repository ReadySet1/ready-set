# üîÑ Restore Instructions for Future Use

## üìã Overview
This document provides comprehensive instructions for restoring GitHub Actions workflows when needed in the future. All workflows are safely archived and can be restored with minimal effort.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start - Restore All Workflows

### **One-Command Full Restore:**
```bash
# Restore all workflows at once
cp -r .github/workflows-archive/*.yml .github/workflows/

# Commit and push the changes
git add .github/workflows/
git commit -m "üîß restore: Re-enable all GitHub Actions workflows"
git push
```

### **What This Does:**
- Copies all 5 workflow files back to active location
- Restores complete CI/CD functionality
- Maintains all original workflow configurations
- No additional configuration required

---

## üîß Selective Workflow Restoration

### **1. Restore Continuous Integration (ci.yml)**
```bash
# Copy CI workflow
cp .github/workflows-archive/ci.yml .github/workflows/

# Commit and push
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
git commit -m "üîß restore: Re-enable CI workflow"
git push
```

**What This Restores:**
- Automated testing and linting
- Security auditing
- Build verification
- Trigger: Push to main/master/feature/*, PR to main/master

### **2. Restore CodeQL Security Scanning (codeql.yml)**
```bash
# Copy CodeQL workflow
cp .github/workflows-archive/codeql.yml .github/workflows/

# Commit and push
git add .github/workflows/codeql.yml
git commit -m "üîß restore: Re-enable CodeQL security scanning"
git push
```

**What This Restores:**
- Automated security vulnerability scanning
- Weekly security analysis
- Trigger: Push to main/master, PR to main/master, weekly schedule

### **3. Restore Test Suite (test.yml)**
```bash
# Copy test workflow
cp .github/workflows-archive/test.yml .github/workflows/

# Commit and push
git add .github/workflows/test.yml
git commit -m "üîß restore: Re-enable test suite workflow"
git push
```

**What This Restores:**
- Unit, E2E, and integration testing
- Test coverage reporting
- Multi-node testing matrix
- Trigger: Push to main/preview-development, PR to main/preview-development

### **4. Restore Production Deployment (deploy-production.yml)**
```bash
# Copy production deployment workflow
cp .github/workflows-archive/deploy-production.yml .github/workflows/

# Commit and push
git add .github/workflows/deploy-production.yml
git commit -m "üîß restore: Re-enable production deployment workflow"
git push
```

**What This Restores:**
- Automated production deployment pipeline
- Manual approval workflow
- Database backup and migration
- Health checks and rollback capabilities
- Trigger: Push to main, workflow_dispatch

### **5. Restore Staging Deployment (deploy-staging.yml)**
```bash
# Copy staging deployment workflow
cp .github/workflows-archive/deploy-staging.yml .github/workflows/

# Commit and push
git add .github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml
git commit -m "üîß restore: Re-enable staging deployment workflow"
git push
```

**What This Restores:**
- Automated staging deployment pipeline
- Pre-deployment health checks
- Database migration automation
- Health checks and notifications
- Trigger: Push to preview-development, workflow_dispatch

## ‚öôÔ∏è Required Configuration After Restoration

### **Environment Variables & Secrets**
After restoring workflows, ensure these secrets are configured in GitHub:

#### **Production Deployment:**
- `PROD_DATABASE_URL`
- `PROD_DIRECT_URL`
- `PROD_SUPABASE_URL`
- `PROD_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `PROD_NEXTAUTH_SECRET`

#### **Staging Deployment:**
- `STAGING_DATABASE_URL`
- `STAGING_DIRECT_URL`
- `STAGING_SUPABASE_URL`
- `STAGING_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `STAGING_NEXTAUTH_SECRET`

#### **Testing & CI:**
- `CODECOV_TOKEN` (for test coverage reporting)

### **GitHub Permissions**
Ensure the repository has appropriate permissions:
- **Actions:** Read and write permissions
- **Contents:** Read permissions
- **Security events:** Write permissions (for CodeQL)

---

## üîç Verification Steps

### **After Restoring Workflows:**
1. **Check GitHub Actions Tab:**
   - Navigate to your repository on GitHub
   - Click on the "Actions" tab
   - Verify workflows are listed and active

2. **Test Workflow Triggers:**
   - Make a small change and push to trigger workflows
   - Check that workflows start running
   - Verify workflow completion

3. **Check Workflow Status:**
   - Monitor workflow runs for any errors
   - Verify all jobs complete successfully
   - Check that notifications are working

---

## üö® Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **Issue: Workflows Not Appearing in Actions Tab**
**Solution:**
```bash
# Ensure workflows are in the correct location
ls -la .github/workflows/

# Check file permissions
chmod 644 .github/workflows/*.yml

# Verify YAML syntax
yamllint .github/workflows/*.yml
```

### **Issue: Workflow Fails Due to Missing Secrets**
**Solution:**
1. Go to GitHub repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
2. Add missing secrets
3. Ensure secret names match exactly (case-sensitive)

### **Issue: Workflow Fails Due to Permissions**
**Solution:**
1. Go to GitHub repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General
2. Ensure "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" is enabled
3. Check workflow-specific permissions in the workflow files

### **Issue: Database Connection Errors**
**Solution:**
1. Verify database URLs are correct
2. Ensure databases are accessible from GitHub Actions
3. Check network security groups and firewall rules

## üéØ Best Practices for Restoration

### **Before Restoring:**
1. **Assess Current Needs:** Determine which workflows are actually needed
2. **Review Dependencies:** Ensure required services are available
3. **Check Team Readiness:** Ensure team can handle CI/CD processes
4. **Plan Rollback:** Have a plan if restoration causes issues

### **During Restoration:**
1. **Start Small:** Restore one workflow at a time
2. **Test Thoroughly:** Verify each workflow works before moving to the next
3. **Monitor Closely:** Watch for any errors or issues
4. **Document Changes:** Keep track of what was restored and when

### **After Restoration:**
1. **Team Communication:** Inform team of restored functionality
2. **Process Updates:** Update deployment and testing procedures
3. **Monitoring:** Set up monitoring for workflow performance
4. **Maintenance:** Plan regular workflow maintenance

## üîÆ Future Considerations

### **Alternative CI/CD Tools:**
Consider these alternatives to GitHub Actions:
- **GitLab CI/CD:** Integrated with GitLab repositories
- **Jenkins:** Self-hosted CI/CD solution
- **CircleCI:** Cloud-based CI/CD platform
- **GitHub Actions (Optimized):** Re-implement with better practices

### **Workflow Optimization:**
When re-implementing workflows:
- **Reduce complexity:** Simplify workflow logic
- **Optimize caching:** Use GitHub Actions cache effectively
- **Parallel execution:** Run independent jobs in parallel
- **Conditional execution:** Only run workflows when necessary
