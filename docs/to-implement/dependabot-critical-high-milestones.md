**Timeline**: 2 weeks (October 13 - October 27, 2025)
**Priority**: P0 (Critical Security Issues)

---

## ðŸ“Š Overview

**Total Alerts to Fix**: 3 unique vulnerabilities (4 alerts)
- 1 Critical: form-data
- 2 High: axios, tar-fs (2 alerts)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Milestone 1: Critical - form-data Unsafe Random Function
**Due Date**: October 17, 2025 (This Week)
**Linear Issue**: [REA-156](https://linear.app/ready-set-llc/issue/REA-156)
**GitHub Alert**: [#2](https://github.com/ReadySet1/ready-set/security/dependabot/2)

### Details
- **Package**: form-data
- **CVE**: CVE-2025-7783
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Issue**: Uses unsafe random function for choosing boundary in multipart/form-data
- **Impact**: Potential for predictable boundary values, leading to request manipulation

### Tasks
- [ ] Review Dependabot PR or create manual PR to update form-data
- [ ] Test file upload functionality across all features:
  - [ ] Profile picture uploads
  - [ ] Document uploads in catering requests
  - [ ] Any other file upload endpoints
- [ ] Run full test suite: `pnpm test`
- [ ] Run build to check for breaking changes: `pnpm build`
- [ ] Deploy to preview environment for QA
- [ ] Merge and deploy to production

### Acceptance Criteria
- âœ… form-data package updated to patched version
- âœ… All tests pass
- âœ… Build succeeds without errors
- âœ… File uploads work in preview environment
- âœ… Alert #2 marked as closed in GitHub

### Estimated Time
2-3 hours

## ðŸŽ¯ Milestone 2: High - axios DoS Vulnerability
**Due Date**: October 22, 2025 (Next Week)
**GitHub Alert**: [#10](https://github.com/ReadySet1/ready-set/security/dependabot/10)

### Details
- **Package**: axios
- **CVE**: CVE-2025-58754
- **Severity**: High
- **Issue**: Vulnerable to DoS attack through lack of data size check
- **Impact**: Attackers could cause denial of service by sending large payloads

### Tasks
- [ ] Review current axios usage in the codebase
- [ ] Check Dependabot PR or create manual update PR
- [ ] Test all API calls:
  - [ ] Supabase client requests
  - [ ] External API integrations (if any)
  - [ ] Internal API routes
- [ ] Consider adding request size limits at the application level
- [ ] Run full test suite: `pnpm test`
- [ ] Run TypeScript check: `pnpm typecheck`
- [ ] Deploy to preview environment
- [ ] Monitor for any regression issues

### Acceptance Criteria
- âœ… axios updated to patched version (check for v1.7.9+ or latest)
- âœ… All HTTP requests working correctly
- âœ… Tests pass
- âœ… TypeScript compilation successful
- âœ… Preview deployment verified
- âœ… Alert #10 marked as closed in GitHub

### Estimated Time
3-4 hours

## ðŸŽ¯ Milestone 3: High - tar-fs Symlink Validation Bypass
**Due Date**: October 24, 2025 (Next Week)
**GitHub Alerts**: [#7](https://github.com/ReadySet1/ready-set/security/dependabot/7), [#8](https://github.com/ReadySet1/ready-set/security/dependabot/8)

### Details
- **Package**: tar-fs
- **CVE**: CVE-2025-59343
- **Severity**: High
- **Issue**: Symlink validation bypass if destination directory is predictable with specific tarball
- **Impact**: Potential for directory traversal attacks during archive extraction
- **Note**: This appears twice (alerts #7 and #8) - likely in different dependency trees

### Tasks
- [ ] Identify where tar-fs is used (likely dev dependency or transitive)
- [ ] Check if direct or transitive dependency
- [ ] Review Dependabot PR or create manual update
- [ ] Verify no archive extraction features in production code
- [ ] If found, audit extraction logic for security
- [ ] Update tar-fs to patched version
- [ ] Run full test suite: `pnpm test`
- [ ] Check for any build/deployment process dependencies
- [ ] Verify CI/CD pipeline still works

### Acceptance Criteria
- âœ… tar-fs updated to patched version
- âœ… Both alerts (#7 and #8) resolved
- âœ… No breaking changes in dev tools
- âœ… CI/CD pipeline runs successfully
- âœ… Tests pass
- âœ… Both alerts marked as closed in GitHub

### Estimated Time
2-3 hours
